= Zeronet Profile Chooser

Switch Zeronet account easily

== Motivation

It is trivial to switch between accounts on Zeronet.

One needs to use the file explorer to replace the users.json under a deep directory manually. There is a need to simplified the process.

== Convention

Different users.json will be placed under /mnt/sdcard/Android/data/net.mkg20001.zeronet/files/zero/data/ followed by the username.

For examples:

- users.json.alice
- users.json.bob

== Reminder

You need to restart the Zeronet daemon after switching account for it to take effect.

== Future Features

- Add Chinese support
- Import account from other directory (e.g. Downloads)
- Import account over the network
